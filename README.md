# VIrus Simulator
 ML Project for UWB Hackathon
The goals of this project was to see how a machine will response to a member in the community that is infected

The Desired user experience is just watch and hopefully understand how the machine is avoiding infection

The Implmenetation was with Unity, Pytorch, Python, C#
Unity was used to build the enviroment
Pytorch was the engine for the agents, using Python
C# was the scripts implemented into the enviroment to distigish a goal, infected person and the effects of running into each

The Learning algorithm that was used was only reinforcement
Reinforcement is rewarding for the correct action and a punishment for the wrong

Lots of issues - physics engine, kool-aid man(people going through walls), Time constraint, Environment being too large for mass learning

What is next
I would like to get the store, work, and park environment working for a better simulation, added an apartment setting, add options for the user to add objects or people. goals for different types of people

The User can't really interact with the current version. Future Goals
